### Hello there 👋,

- I'm Emillia-rosette and I'm a PhD student in Artificial Intelligence and I'm especially interested in the intersection of data science and social impact, in areas like traffic management and education.

- Here on my GitHub profile, I share my research project on Traffic prediction where I aim to build a predictive data analysis model to support strategic decisions to help companies and transport managers optimise in real-time transport information such scheduling road works, passenger’s time and stops usage in London 📊 

- I am also completing the CS50's Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python course by HarvardX and my projects to date can also be found in [my website portfolio](http://emillianlandu.com/). I also write on Medium 📝 and share my articles and ideas in Towards Data Science and [Research gate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Emillia-Rosette-Nlandu-Nzinga/projects)
