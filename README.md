### Hi there 👋,

- 📚 I'm Emillia-rosette, a PhD candidate in Artificial Intelligence, and I'm especially interested in the intersection of data science and social impact in traffic management and education.

- 👾 Here on my GitHub profile, I share [my research project](https://www.kingston.ac.uk/research/research-degrees/research-degree-students/profile/emillia-rosette-nlandu-nzinga-415/) on Traffic prediction where I aim to build a predictive data analysis model to support strategic decisions to help companies and transport managers optimise in real-time transport information such scheduling road works, passenger’s time and stops usage in London 📊 

- 📝I am also completing the CS50's Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python course by HarvardX and my projects to date can also be found in [my website portfolio](http://emillianlandu.com/). I also write on Medium and my articles can be found in [Research gate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Emillia-Rosette-Nlandu-Nzinga/projects)
