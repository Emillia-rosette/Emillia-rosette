Hi, Emillia-rosette ((with two 'lls' 😊 | ‘Em-i-lee-a’ 'rō-zĕt′) here, 

- 😄 I am a passionate data scientist with a foundation in cloud solutions. Currently, I am advancing my expertise in artificial intelligence as part of my PhD research at Kingston University. My research focuses on Traffic Flow Prediction, using machine learning and time-series analysis to forecast congestion patterns across UK regions.
- 🔭 Check out my projects to see how I bring data-driven approaches to life through a combination of cloud and data science expertise. Let’s collaborate and create something amazing together!
