### Hi there 👋🏿,

I am Emillia-rosette Nlandu, my friends call me Emillia (with two 'lls' 😊).  Let me take you on a deep dive into my tech journey up to this point: 

- 🚀 Over the initial six years of my career, I've devoted myself to the art of creating innovative solutions, accumulating expertise in diverse domains including software development, customer success, enterprise technical support engineering, and cloud platforms. 

- 🔍 I'm presently engaged in a PhD research program in Artificial Intelligence at Kingston University(click [here](https://www.kingston.ac.uk/research/research-degrees/research-degree-students/profile/emillia-rosette-nlandu-nzinga-415/) for bio), where my research is centred on 'Data-Driven Strategies for Urban Planning Coordination.' Within this framework, I'm exploring Traffic Prediction Optimization and Roadwork Impact Assessment to elevate the precision of traffic forecasts, alleviate traffic congestion, and establish a framework for evaluating the influence of ongoing roadwork projects on traffic flow. This research also emphasizes the importance of fostering collaboration between city departments and urban planning entities for more efficient urban planning and traffic management. 
- Outside the realm of my professional journey, I am a passionate champion for diversity within the tech industry. In furtherance of this mission, I assume a leadership role at Cheetah Code Academy, where I spearhead coding bootcamps. These programs are designed to mentor and instruct individuals from diverse, minority heritage backgrounds, equipping them with the skills and knowledge needed to unlock the vast world of coding and break into the dynamic tech industry.
