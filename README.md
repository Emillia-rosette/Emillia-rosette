### Hi there 👋,

I am Emillia-rosette Nlnadu, my friends call me Emillia (with two 'lls' 😊).  Let me take you on a deep dive into my tech journey up to this point: 

- 🚀 I've dedicated the first six years of my career to crafting innovative solutions, gaining expertise across software development, customer success & enterprise technical support engineering, and cloud platforms. 

- 🔍 I'm currently pursuing a PhD research degree in Artificial Intelligence at Kingston University with a focus on "Data-Driven Strategies for Urban Planning Coordination". The research looks into Traffic Prediction Optimization and roadwork Impact Assessment to enhance Traffic Prediction Accuracy, reduce Traffic Congestion and create a framework for assessing the impact of ongoing roadwork projects on traffic flow to foster collaboration between city departments and urban planning entities.
