### Hi there 👋🏿,

I am Emillia-rosette Nlandu, my friends call me Emillia (with two 'lls' 😊).  Let me take you on a deep dive into my tech journey up to this point: 

- 🚀 Over the last six years of my career, I've devoted myself to the art of creating innovative solutions, accumulating expertise in diverse domains including software development, customer success, enterprise technical support engineering, and cloud platforms. 

- 🔍 I'm presently engaged in a PhD research program in Artificial Intelligence at Kingston University(click [here](https://www.kingston.ac.uk/research/research-degrees/research-degree-students/profile/emillia-rosette-nlandu-nzinga-415/) for bio), where my research is centred on 'Data-Driven Strategies for Urban Planning Coordination.' Within this framework, I'm exploring Traffic Prediction Optimization and Roadwork Impact Assessment to elevate the precision of traffic forecasts, alleviate traffic congestion, and establish a framework for evaluating the influence of ongoing roadwork projects on traffic flow.
- Some of my  contributions to open-source projects can be found on platforms like [Medium](https://medium.com/@emillianlandu), where I actively engage with the community, as well as on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/9870311/emillia-rosette-nlandu) where I've asked and shared knowledge. Additionally, you can explore my research contributions on [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Emillia-Rosette-Nlandu-Nzinga), where I've shared insights and findings from my academic endeavours.
