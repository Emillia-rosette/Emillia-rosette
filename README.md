### Hi there 👋🏿,

I am Emillia-rosette Nlandu-Nzinga, my friends call me Emillia (with two 'lls' 😊 | ‘Em-i-lee-a’ 'rō-zĕt′). Here are a few things about me: 

- 🔍 I'm presently engaged in a PhD research program in Artificial Intelligence at Kingston University(click [here](https://www.kingston.ac.uk/research/research-degrees/research-degree-students/profile/emillia-rosette-nlandu-nzinga-415/) for bio), where my research is centred on 'Data-Driven Strategies for Urban Planning Coordination.' Within this framework, I'm exploring Traffic Prediction Optimization and Roadwork Impact Assessment to elevate the precision of traffic forecasts, alleviate traffic congestion, and establish a framework for evaluating the influence of ongoing roadwork projects on traffic flow.
- Some of my  contributions to open-source projects can be found on platforms like [Medium](https://medium.com/@emillianlandu), where I actively engage with the community, as well as on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/9870311/emillia-rosette-nlandu) where I've asked and shared knowledge. Additionally, you can explore my research contributions on [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Emillia-Rosette-Nlandu-Nzinga), where I've shared insights and findings from my academic endeavours.
